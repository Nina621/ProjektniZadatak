               <h2><i> What’s new in Flutter 2.5</i></h2>
               <p class="description">Hello and welcome to Flutter 2.5! This is a big release, with the 2nd highest stats in the history of Flutter releases: 4600 issues closed and 3932 PRs merged from 252 contributors with 216 reviewers. If we look back over the last year, we see a huge 21,072 PRs created by 1337 contributors, of which 15,172 of them were merged.</p>
               <p><i>This release is jam-packed with exciting new updates, so let’s get started.</i></p>
               <p><i>This release comes with several performance improvements. First on this list is a PR to wire up Metal shader precompilation from offline training runs (#25644), which (as our benchmarks show) cuts worst case frame rasterization times by 2/3s, and the 99th percentile frame by half. We continue to make progress on reducing iOS jank and this is another step along that path.</i></p>
               <p><i>Of course, Flutter isn’t Flutter without the Dart language and runtime on which it builds. </i></p>
               <p><i> This release of Flutter comes with Dart 2.14. </i></p>
               <p><i>In addition, and one of the best things about Dart 2.14, is that this release has created a standard set of lints shared between new Dart and Flutter projects that come right out of the box.</i></p>
